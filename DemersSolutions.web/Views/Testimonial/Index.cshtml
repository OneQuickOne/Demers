            I have used Ryan, owner of Demers Solutions for years, for many different jobs.
            From big to small he always goes the extra bit to make it "perfect".<br />
            His work is always clean and professional, looks like it's it out of a magazine!

            <br />
            I would recommend his work to anyone who is considering home security/automation.

            I have known Ryan Demers, and retained him in various capacities, for a very long time. 
            He is a reliable, hard-working and trustworthy person. He has dedicated himself to the alarm, 
            automation and entertainment field, and I am happy to recommend his services.
